# CFG Python MOOC
### team-indigo
In this repo, we have attempted to solve the CFG Python MOOC Challenge to crack a password using BootForce Technique. All team members approached the problem differently and proposed the solution on an individual file. Our final solution is at the file password_cracker_gui.py [Final Solution Link](https://github.com/goldfishdolphin/team-indigo/blob/main/password_cracker_gui.py) .

 Our Presentation is available on the link [Team Indigo Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PbtzZLiQiD0HOkK8Wrp8bzHVITqO6SO3HUu55-eE_Fk/edit#slide=id.p1)
